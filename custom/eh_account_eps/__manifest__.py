    'name': 'Earnings Per Share (IAS 33)',
    'summary': 'IAS 33 basic and diluted earnings per share for Odoo 17 Community, computed from earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders over a weighted average share count built from dated movements. odoo 19 earnings per share, IAS 33 EPS, basic diluted EPS, weighted average number of ordinary shares, dilutive potential ordinary shares, treasury stock method options, average market price observations, anti-dilutive exclusion, preference dividend deduction, bonus issue share split restatement, continuing discontinued operations EPS, EPS disclosure computation.',
    'description': 'This module adds an Earnings Per Share run that computes basic and diluted EPS under IAS 33 with no journal postings, so it is a pure disclosure calculation. Basic EPS is profit attributable to ordinary holders (net profit less after-tax preference dividends) divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares, and that weighted average is built from dated share movements, each weighted by the number of days it was outstanding within the period. Diluted EPS sequences potential ordinary shares most-dilutive first, adding each instrument only while it continues to reduce EPS, so anti-dilutive classes are excluded and diluted EPS is never reported above basic. When earnings are split between continuing and discontinued operations, the run reports basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations with the discontinued amount disclosed as the difference, uses continuing profit as the control number for the dilution test, and can prefill the discontinued result from the ledger where the held-for-sale module is installed. Bonus issues, splits, and consolidations are recorded as dated restatement events applied retrospectively to the weighted average, with their cumulative factor restating the comparative period, and the treasury-stock method can resolve its average market price from dated price observations inside the period instead of a single scalar. Once a run is computed, its earnings and share figures are frozen against silent edits, additions, and deletions across the run and its child lines.',
