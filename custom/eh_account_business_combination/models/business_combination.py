"""
eh.business.combination: an IFRS 3 acquisition and its goodwill.

Goodwill = consideration transferred (including the acquisition-date fair
value of contingent consideration, IFRS 3.39) + non-controlling interest
+ fair value of any previously-held interest - fair value of identifiable
net assets acquired (IFRS 3.32). A negative result is a bargain purchase
gain recognised in profit or loss (IFRS 3.34).

Step acquisitions remeasure the previously-held interest to acquisition-date
fair value with the gain or loss in profit or loss (IFRS 3.42). Subsequent
mechanics live in business_combination_subsequent.py: measurement-period
adjustments (IFRS 3.45-49) and contingent-consideration remeasurement
(IFRS 3.58).
