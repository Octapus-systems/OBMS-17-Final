    'description': 'A management accounting layer for Odoo 17 Community. Standard cost cards hold the per-unit standard quantity and price of each cost element (material, labour, variable overhead, fixed overhead) for a product or free-form item, with one active card per product enforced. Period actuals capture the units produced and the total input quantity and cost per element. The variance run decomposes the difference between actual cost and standard cost absorbed into the full two-way variance set: material price and usage, labour rate and efficiency, variable overhead spend and efficiency, fixed overhead spend and volume, with a favourable-negative sign convention and a reconciliation identity (the variance lines always sum exactly to total actual cost minus total standard cost absorbed) enforced by constraint. Posting is optional and off by default: in analysis-only mode nothing touches the ledger; with posting enabled the run books the variance set as one balanced, sealed journal entry against per-kind variance accounts and an absorption account. The contribution report computes contribution margin per product from the standard variable cost, picks up revenue manually or from posted invoice lines, and derives the CVP set: break-even units and revenue, target-profit units, margin of safety and degree of operating leverage. Inventory valuation integration with stock moves is documented as a later wave; this release is deliberately ledger-independent on the input side so it fits any inventory setup. Posting is gated to the EH Accounting Manager group and every generated journal entry is sealed against edit.',
