    'description': 'A dedicated IFRS 2 share-based payment engine for Odoo 17 Community. Plans define the settlement mode, vesting terms and condition kind; grants under a plan carry the instruments, the grant-date fair value and an updatable forfeiture estimate. Period runs compute the cumulative expense per IFRS 2 and post the period delta as a sealed journal entry: equity-settled awards accrue grant-date fair value times the instruments expected to vest times the vested fraction (each graded tranche over its own vesting period), estimates true up through the current period, non-market failures reverse in full while market-condition failures never reverse once service is rendered, and cash-settled awards remeasure the liability to current fair value each period until settlement. Beneficial modifications spread their incremental fair value over the remaining vesting period, cancellation accelerates the unrecognised balance immediately, and a built-in valuation helper prices options with Black-Scholes or a Cox-Ross-Rubinstein binomial tree. The plan carries an IFRS 2.45 rollforward of granted, forfeited, exercised and expired instruments with the weighted average exercise price. Posting is gated to the EH Accounting Manager group and every generated journal entry is sealed against edit.',  # noqa: E501
