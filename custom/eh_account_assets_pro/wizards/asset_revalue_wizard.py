Asset revaluation wizard.

Two flavours:

* Uplift  Dr Asset, Cr Revaluation Reserve / Income (counterpart_account_id).
          The uplift also increments the asset's revaluation_surplus, the
          equity reserve balance tracked per IAS 16.39.
* Impair  IAS 16.40 downward revaluation. The decrease first reverses any
          existing revaluation surplus (Dr Revaluation Reserve up to the
          surplus balance) and only the excess is recognised in P&L
          (Dr Impairment / Expense via counterpart_account_id):

            dr_to_reserve = min(amount, revaluation_surplus)
            dr_to_pl      = amount - dr_to_reserve
            Dr Revaluation Reserve  dr_to_reserve
            Dr Impairment / Expense dr_to_pl
            Cr Asset                amount

          The surplus is decremented by dr_to_reserve.

After posting, the remaining (unposted) schedule lines are wiped and a
fresh straight line schedule is generated over the remaining useful
life on the new net book value.
