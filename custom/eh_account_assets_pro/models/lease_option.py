eh.lease.option: extension / termination / purchase options on an IFRS 16
lease contract.

IFRS 16.18-19: the lease term comprises the non-cancellable period plus
periods covered by an extension option the lessee is REASONABLY CERTAIN
to exercise (and periods after a termination option it is reasonably
certain NOT to exercise). IFRS 16.27 includes in the lease payments the
exercise price of a purchase option, and penalties for terminating, when
the corresponding exercise is reasonably certain.

Only options flagged reasonably_certain affect measurement:

* extension: its months extend the term used for the schedule and the
  liability PV.
* termination: its penalty is added to the final period's payment and
  its present value to the initial liability.
* purchase: its price is added to the final period's payment and its
  present value to the initial liability; the ROU asset is then
  depreciated over the underlying asset's useful life rather than the
  lease term (IFRS 16.32).

Options are frozen once the lease leaves draft: the schedule and opening
entry were measured off them, so later changes must go through the
modification wizard, never an in-place edit.
