"""Golden IAS 37 worked examples for eh_account_provisions.

Each test is a hand-computed worked example in the shape of the IAS 37
illustrative material (numbers only, recomputed by hand from the inputs
stated in the test). The exact journal entry the engine posts is asserted
line by line against literal amounts; nothing is read back from the engine
under test to build an expected value.

Unwind convention implemented by eh.provision.action_unwind (read from
models/provision.py):

* COMPOUND accretion. For each whole period that has fallen due, the step
  is interest_k = carrying x rate and the carrying amount is raised by that
  step before the next one, so a multi-period catch-up books the sum of the
  compounded steps. The total is rounded once to company currency at the
  end. For a single period, simple and compound coincide.
* Day-count schedule. When the provision carries a recognition date, an
  expected settlement date and n periods, the day span is split into n
  equal steps: boundary k sits at recognition + round(total_days * k / n)
  days. Only whole periods whose boundary today has reached accrete; there
  is no intra-period day-level proration, and a repeat run inside the same
  period is refused. Without a settlement date the fallback is one period
  per click at carrying x rate.
* Accretion is capped so the carrying amount never exceeds the
  undiscounted best estimate.
