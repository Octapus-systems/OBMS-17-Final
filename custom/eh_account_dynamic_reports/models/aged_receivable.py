Aged Receivable handler.

Open balances on receivable accounts (asset_receivable, asset_current that
participates in invoicing) bucketed by days overdue. Sign is +1 because a
receivable is naturally a positive amount the customer owes us.

Inherits all bucket / rendering logic from the aged base; only the account
type tuple and SIGN differ from Aged Payable.
