"""Regression: the vendor-bill intake state machine is enforced by
eh.workflow.guard (sudo provenance), not merely by a readonly statusbar.

The intake advances received -> parsed -> matched -> posted through its own
actions (action_parse/action_match/action_post), which carry the manager
check, duplicate block and the sealed journal entry. A plain user must NOT be
able to skip that with a direct RPC ``write({'state': 'posted'})``. The guard
blocks any non-superuser write to 'state'; the sanctioned actions run under
sudo and are unaffected.

The test env runs as SUPERUSER, so the negative assertion is made through
``with_user(a plain user)`` - as the superuser the guard is (correctly) a
no-op.
