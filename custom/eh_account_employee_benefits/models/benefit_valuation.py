eh.benefit.valuation: one period's actuarial import for a defined benefit
plan, and the IAS 19 ledger mechanics computed from it.

Scope: the actuarial figures (obligation, plan assets, service cost,
actuarial gains and losses, asset ceiling) are IMPORTED INPUTS keyed from
the actuary's report. The module computes only what IAS 19 requires of the
ledger: interest at the discount rate, the P&L vs OCI routing, the asset
ceiling cap, the rollforward ties and one balanced sealed journal entry.

Sign conventions (documented once, used everywhere):

* actuarial_gain_loss_dbo: LOSS POSITIVE. A positive amount is an
  actuarial loss that increases the obligation and is debited to OCI.
* return_on_assets_excess: GAIN POSITIVE. A positive amount is actual
  return above the interest income component; it increases plan assets and
  is credited to OCI.
* oci_remeasurement: LOSS POSITIVE (debit to OCI) =
  actuarial_gain_loss_dbo - return_on_assets_excess + ceiling_effect_delta.
* settlement_gain_loss: GAIN POSITIVE = settlement_dbo_released -
  settlement_payment (IAS 19.109-112); a gain is credited to the service
  cost account (IAS 19.8 includes settlement results in service cost).
* net_liability = closing_dbo - closing_assets (positive = liability,
  negative = surplus before the asset ceiling).

Net interest simplification (IAS 19.123): net interest = discount rate x
OPENING balances (interest_cost = rate x opening DBO, interest_income =
rate x opening plan assets). Mid-year weighting of contributions and
benefit payments in the interest computation is a permitted refinement and
is OUT OF SCOPE here; likewise interest on the asset ceiling effect is not
split out of net interest, the whole change in the ceiling effect routes
to OCI (stated simplification, consistent with rate x opening balances).

Rollforward mechanics and rounding order (each step rounded to company
currency, mirrored by the golden-test oracles):

    interest_cost   = round(rate x opening_dbo)
    interest_income = round(rate x opening_assets)
    net_interest    = interest_cost - interest_income
    closing_dbo     = round(opening_dbo + current_service_cost
                            + past_service_cost + interest_cost
                            - benefits_paid + actuarial_gain_loss_dbo
                            - settlement_dbo_released)
    closing_assets  = round(opening_assets + interest_income
                            + contributions_employer
                            + return_on_assets_excess
                            - (benefits_paid + settlement_payment
                               when the plan is funded; an unfunded plan
                               pays both from employer cash))

closing_dbo and closing_assets are stored editable computes: the actuary's
reported closing figures may be keyed over them, and the ROLLFORWARD TIE
constraint refuses any keyed closing that does not reconcile to the
movement analysis within 0.01 (the audit-proof requirement). Opening
figures chain to the prior posted valuation under the same tolerance.

Asset ceiling (IAS 19.64): when the closing position is a surplus,
recognised asset = min(surplus, asset_ceiling); the unrecognisable excess
(ceiling_effect) is a valuation allowance credited to the plan asset
account, and its period change routes to OCI remeasurement, disclosed
separately in the ceiling schedule.

Worked table (golden example 1, funded plan, rate 5 pct,
contributions_posted_elsewhere = True):

    inputs   opening DBO 1,000,000 / assets 800,000; service cost 60,000;
             benefits paid 30,000; contributions 45,000; actuarial loss
             20,000; return excess +5,000
    derive   interest cost 50,000; interest income 40,000; net interest
             10,000; closing DBO 1,100,000; closing assets 860,000; net
             liability 240,000 (opening 200,000); OCI loss 15,000;
             P&L 70,000
    entry    Dr service cost           60,000
             Dr net interest           10,000
             Dr OCI remeasurement      15,000
             Dr plan assets            60,000   (movement 860k - 800k)
             Cr DBO liability         100,000   (movement 1,100k - 1,000k)
             Cr contribution clearing  45,000

The entry balances by the identity: delta DBO - delta assets =
service cost + net interest + remeasurement (pre-ceiling) - contributions
- settlement gain. Benefits paid by a funded plan appear on both movement
deltas and cancel, so they never touch employer cash here.
