"""
SEPA character-set sanitisation.

ISO 20022 SEPA payment messages restrict free-text fields (names,
remittance information, identifiers) to the Latin character set:

    a-z A-Z 0-9 space and / - ? : ( ) . , ' +

Characters outside this set (accented Latin, non-Latin scripts, other
punctuation) are rejected by many banks' validation gateways. This
helper transliterates accented Latin characters to their ASCII base
(for example e-acute becomes e) and replaces anything still outside the
allowed set with a space, so generated XML always clears SEPA character
validation.

This lives in eh_account_sepa_ct because eh_account_sepa_dd already
depends on it; both modules import sanitize_sepa_text from here.
