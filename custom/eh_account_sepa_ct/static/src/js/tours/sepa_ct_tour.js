/**
 * Onboarding tour for SEPA Credit Transfer (PAIN.001) export.
 *
 * 5 steps explaining the four prerequisites a finance team has to
 * line up before a batch can produce a bank-acceptable XML file:
 *
 *   1. SEPA Originator config per bank journal (IBAN/BIC validated).
 *   2. Partner bank accounts on every payee (IBAN required).
 *   3. Outbound batch payment with posted lines.
 *   4. Single-currency rule (we refuse mixed-currency batches).
 *   5. Click Export — produces a downloadable .xml + audit row.
 *
 * Trigger: ?tour=eh_sepa_ct_setup_tour
