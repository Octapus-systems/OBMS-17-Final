"""
Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) daily exchange rates.

CBK publishes ~10 currencies (AED, BHD, CHF, EUR, GBP, JPY, OMR, QAR,
SAR, USD) as fils per unit against the Kuwaiti Dinar. KWD floats against
an undisclosed basket, so this daily feed is the correct source (a static
peg would be wrong). Undocumented but stable fixed-path XML.

Native base is KWD. The feed quotes each foreign currency as a rate in
fils per one unit of that currency, and 1 KWD = 1000 fils. So one unit of
a listed CODE costs rate/1000 KWD, and conversely 1 KWD buys 1000/rate
units of CODE. We build the native table directly in the cross-derivation
direction, "1 KWD expressed in units of CODE", and let the base class
pivot it onto the company currency.

The document declares a UTF-8 encoding and may be served with or without
a namespace, so we match on local tag names rather than a fixed path.
