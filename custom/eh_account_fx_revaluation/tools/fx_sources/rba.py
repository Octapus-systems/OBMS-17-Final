"""
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) exchange-rate provider.

The RBA publishes its daily exchange rates as an RDF/RSS feed. The
native base is always AUD: every quoted figure is "1 AUD expressed in
units of the target currency", so the table is already in the direction
the cross-derivation expects and no inversion is needed.

The feed mixes the RDF syntax namespace with the central-bank 'cb'
vocabulary (http://www.cbwiki.net/wiki/index.php/Specification_1.1). We
parse it namespace-agnostically: every element is matched on its local
tag name (the part after the closing brace) so a change of namespace URI
or prefix on the RBA side does not silently break the parser.

Source feed:
* https://www.rba.gov.au/rss/rss-cb-exchange-rates.xml

This module is original work; the parser implements the published RDF/RSS
shape and does not derive from any third-party rate library.
