"""
Sveriges Riksbank (Swedish central bank) FX rate source.

The Riksbank publishes a daily "observations" group of cross rates for
its main convertible currencies through the SWEA API. Group 130 carries
the latest observation per series, each series keyed by a nine-character
seriesId of the form 'SEK' + three-letter CODE + 'PMI', whose value is
the number of Swedish kronor per one unit of CODE (1 CODE = value SEK).

Native base is SEK. Because the feed states "1 CODE = value SEK", we
invert each row into the cross-derivation direction "1 SEK = 1/value
CODE" and let the base class re-express that table against the company
currency. Only series whose seriesId is nine characters long and matches
the 'SEK...PMI' pattern are read; the CODE is taken from seriesId[3:6].
Rows with a missing, unparseable, or zero value are skipped so one bad
line never sinks the whole table.

Endpoint:
* https://api.riksbank.se/swea/v1/Observations/Latest/ByGroup/130

The Riksbank SWEA API is freely reusable without charge and requires no
key. Data reuse should credit Sveriges Riksbank as the source per the
bank's published terms.
