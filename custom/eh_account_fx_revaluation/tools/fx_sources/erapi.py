"""
Open ExchangeRate API broad-coverage source.

A free, multi-base aggregator that serves the requested base currency
directly, so no cross-derivation is needed: the feed already returns
"1 unit of base in units of code" for the base passed in the URL.

Characteristics:
* Broad coverage, roughly 160 currencies in a single response.
* Latest rates only; the free tier exposes no historical lookup, so
  ``on_date`` is accepted for interface symmetry but not honoured.
* Aggregated mid-market data, no operator API key required.

Because the API pivots to any requested base itself, this provider
overrides ``fetch`` rather than ``_fetch_native``, and never calls
``cross_derive``.
