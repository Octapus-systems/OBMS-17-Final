"""
HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) monthly exchange-rate provider.

HMRC publishes ONE rate per currency per calendar month for UK customs
and VAT purposes through the Trade Tariff service. The rate is constant
within the month, so the daily revaluation cron always writes the
current month's value; HMRC does not vary the figure day to day.

The native base is always GBP. Each <exchangeRate> row carries a
<rateNew> field that reads "1 GBP = rateNew CODE" (foreign units per one
pound), which is already the direction the cross-derivation expects, so
``_fetch_native`` stores ``native[CODE] = to_decimal(rateNew)`` with no
inversion. The base class then re-expresses that table against the
company currency, so this module never calls cross_derive itself.

Endpoint (one XML file per month, keyed by the year-month of on_date):
* https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/api/v2/exchange_rates/files/
  monthly_xml_{YYYY-MM}.xml

The feed is parsed namespace-agnostically: every element is matched on
its local tag name (the part after the closing brace) so a change of
namespace URI or prefix on the HMRC side does not silently break the
parser.

This module is original work; the parser implements the published
monthly XML shape and does not derive from any third-party rate library.
