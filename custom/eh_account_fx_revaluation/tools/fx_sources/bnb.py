"""
Bulgarian National Bank (Balgarska Narodna Banka) rate source.

The bank publishes a daily list of exchange rates for the convertible
currencies it tracks, expressed as foreign currency units per one euro.
Each row already reads "1 EUR = RATE CODE", normalised per single euro,
so for the native EUR base we take the published RATE directly with no
inversion and no quantity scaling.

Endpoint:
* https://www.bnb.bg/Statistics/StExternalSector/StExchangeRates/StERForeignCurrencies/?download=xml&lang=EN

The XML root is a flat ROWSET of ROW elements. The first ROW carries a
TITLE header and has no CODE child; it is skipped. Every data ROW has a
CODE and a RATE child, and the ROWSET has no XML namespace, so plain
find('CODE') / find('RATE') resolve.

The feed does not list the Bulgarian lev itself. The lev is pegged to the
euro by law at 1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN, so we inject that fixed entry after
parsing. This lets a company reporting in BGN be cross-derived against any
currency the euro table reaches.

Source: Bulgarian National Bank. Reuse of the published rates is permitted
with attribution to the Bulgarian National Bank as the source of the data.
This module is original work; the parser implements the published XML
shape and does not derive from any third-party rate library.
