"""
Fixer.io foreign-exchange rate source.

Fixer is a keyed aggregator. The free tier publishes against a fixed
EUR base; the operator supplies an API key on the FX rate configuration.
Each ``rates`` value is "1 EUR expressed in units of the quoted
currency", which is exactly the direction the registry expects, so the
values pass straight through with no inversion. The native base is EUR
and the base class pivots the table onto the company currency.

Endpoint:
* https://data.fixer.io/api/latest?access_key={KEY}&symbols={CSV}

The symbol list includes the company base alongside the wanted quotes so
the cross derivation has the EUR/base leg available when the company is
not on EUR. The response is JSON::

    {"success": true, "timestamp": ..., "base": "EUR",
     "date": "2026-05-01", "rates": {"USD": 1.0800, "GBP": 0.8500}}

On a feed-level problem Fixer returns ``"success": false`` with an
``error`` object; we raise the published ``info`` string so the caller
surfaces the real cause (bad key, exhausted quota) rather than a blank
table. The base class fetch() already calls _require_key() before
_fetch_native, so a missing key raises without a duplicate guard here.
