"""
Central Bank of Brazil (Banco Central do Brasil) PTAX rates.

Native base BRL. The PTAX series is published through the Olinda OData
API and, for the per-day endpoints used here, only carries the US dollar
and the euro against the real. That is by design: we return whatever the
feed serves and let ``cross_derive`` surface the gap for any other quote.

The Olinda feed publishes each rate as "1 unit of the foreign currency in
reais" (the cotacaoVenda / selling quote). Our table is expressed the
other way round, as "1 BRL in units of the foreign currency", so we invert
each published quote before handing the table to the base class.

Endpoints take the quote date as MM-DD-YYYY. The dollar has its own
resource (CotacaoDolarDia); every other currency, including the euro, goes
through the generic CotacaoMoedaDia resource keyed by the ISO code. On a
non-business day the OData "value" array comes back empty; we skip that
currency rather than treat the gap as an error.
