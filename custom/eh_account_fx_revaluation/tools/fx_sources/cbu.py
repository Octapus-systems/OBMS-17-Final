"""
Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan daily rates.

Native base is UZS. The bank publishes a single JSON array for the
latest archive day at the endpoint below, one object per currency. The
feed is open government data; reuse carries the attribution requirement
"Source: Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan".

Each object carries a ``Nominal`` (a quantity of the foreign currency)
and a ``Rate`` (that quantity expressed in soms). So the feed states
"Nominal units of CODE = Rate UZS", which means 1 CODE = Rate / Nominal
UZS. Cross derivation wants the table keyed as "1 UZS = X CODE", which is
the inverse: X = Nominal / Rate. We build the native table directly in
that direction and let the base class pivot it onto the company
currency. The ``Nominal`` is not always 1 (for example JPY is quoted per
100 units), so it must be read per row rather than assumed.

Endpoint:
* https://cbu.uz/en/arkhiv-kursov-valyut/json/

The feed publishes business-day data only; weekend and Uzbek holiday
requests resolve to the most recent published archive, which matches the
provider contract of "the rate on or before this date".
