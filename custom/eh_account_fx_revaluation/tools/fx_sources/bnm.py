Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) Exchange Rate OpenAPI source.

BNM publishes a daily list of foreign-exchange reference rates against the
ringgit. The BNM OpenAPI is free for everyone to use and needs no API key,
but it requires the request to advertise the API version through an Accept
header: every call must send

    Accept: application/vnd.BNM.API.v1+json

The endpoint rejects requests that omit it, so the header is passed through
``_download_json`` rather than relying on the default. Reuse of the data
should carry the standard attribution to Bank Negara Malaysia as the source.

Endpoint:
* https://api.bnm.gov.my/public/exchange-rate

Each row in ``data`` carries a ``currency_code``, a ``unit`` (the number of
foreign units the quote is expressed per, e.g. 100 for the yen), and a
``rate`` object with ``buying_rate``, ``selling_rate``, and ``middle_rate``.
The middle rate is "1 unit-block of CODE = middle_rate MYR", so one unit of
CODE is ``middle_rate / unit`` MYR. The native base is the ringgit, so the
table is keyed as "1 MYR = unit / middle_rate CODE"; the base class then
cross-derives that table onto the company currency.

``middle_rate`` is preferred; a row that omits it (or carries null) falls
back to ``selling_rate``. Rows whose chosen rate or unit is missing,
unparseable, or zero are skipped so one bad row never poisons the table.

This module is original work; the parser implements the published JSON
shape and does not derive from any third-party rate library.
