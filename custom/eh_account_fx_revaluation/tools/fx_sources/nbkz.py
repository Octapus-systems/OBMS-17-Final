"""
National Bank of Kazakhstan (Qazaqstan Ulttyq Banki) daily rates.

Native base is KZT. The bank publishes its official rates as an RSS 2.0
document at the endpoint below. Each ``<item>`` carries a ``<title>``
(the ISO currency code), a ``<description>`` (a tenge figure), and a
``<quant>`` (the quantity of foreign units that figure prices). So the
feed states "quant units of CODE = description KZT", which means
1 CODE = description / quant KZT. Cross derivation wants the table keyed
as "1 KZT = X CODE", which is the inverse: X = quant / description. We
build the native table directly in that direction and let the base class
pivot it onto the company currency.

The ``<quant>`` element is not always 1: minor or low-value currencies
are quoted per 10 or per 100 units, so the quantity must be honoured or
the derived rate is off by an order of magnitude.

Source feed:
* https://nationalbank.kz/rss/rates_all.xml

We parse the feed namespace-agnostically: every element is matched on its
local tag name (the part after the closing brace) so a namespaced
``quant`` element, or a change of namespace URI or prefix on the bank's
side, does not silently break the parser.

Source: National Bank of Kazakhstan. The feed is published for reuse; the
data carries the source's attribution requirement, so any redistribution
must cite the National Bank of Kazakhstan as the originator.

This module is original work; the parser implements the published RSS
shape and does not derive from any third-party rate library.
