"""
Central Reserve Bank of Peru (Banco Central de Reserva del Peru) rate
source.

Native base is USD. The bank publishes its statistical series through a
JSON API, one series per endpoint. Series PD04640PD is the official sol
per US dollar interbank sell rate, so this source carries a single pair,
the sol against the dollar, and lets cross_derive surface a gap for any
other currency.

Endpoint:
* https://estadisticas.bcrp.gob.pe/estadisticas/series/api/PD04640PD/json

The payload holds a ``periods`` array, newest period last, where each
period exposes a ``name`` (the publication day) and a ``values`` array
whose first element is the published rate. Non-business days publish the
sentinel string "n.d." instead of a number, so we walk the periods from
the last (newest) to the first (oldest) and take the first whose value
parses, matching the provider contract of "the rate on or before this
date". Each usable value is "1 USD = value PEN", which is already the
native direction this source needs; we key it as "1 USD in units of PEN".
When no period carries a usable value we return an empty table, which the
base class derivation then surfaces as a gap, or raises when the company
base itself cannot be served.

Data reuse: the series are published as open statistical data. Any
redistribution must retain the attribution "Source: Banco Central de
Reserva del Peru"; reproduction is permitted citing the source.

This module is original work; the parser below implements the published
JSON shape and does not derive from any third-party rate library.
