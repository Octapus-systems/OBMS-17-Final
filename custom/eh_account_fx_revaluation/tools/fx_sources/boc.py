Bank of Canada daily FX rate provider.

The Bank of Canada publishes a daily series of foreign-exchange rates
through its Valet observations API. The FX_RATES_DAILY group carries
around 26 currencies quoted on Canadian business days; the bank does not
publish on weekends or Canadian holidays. We pull the latest observation
and use it for the daily revaluation cron.

Each series key follows the pattern FX<XXX>CAD where XXX is the foreign
currency, and the value is "1 unit of XXX expressed in CAD" (CAD per one
unit of the foreign currency). Our native table is published against the
native base CAD as "1 CAD in units of code", so we invert each published
value: native[XXX] = 1 / (CAD per XXX). The base class then cross-derives
against the company currency.
