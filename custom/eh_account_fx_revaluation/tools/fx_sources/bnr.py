"""
National Bank of Romania (Banca Nationala a Romaniei) daily rates.

Native base is RON. The bank publishes a single XML document for the
latest business day at the endpoint below. The reference rates sit under
DataSet/Body/Cube, one <Rate> per currency, declared in the
http://www.bnr.ro/xsd namespace.

Each <Rate> states "multiplier units of CODE = Rate RON", where the
multiplier attribute is optional and defaults to 1 (it is present only
for low-value currencies such as JPY, quoted per 100). So the feed reads
1 CODE = Rate / multiplier RON. The cross derivation wants the table
keyed as "1 RON = X CODE", which is the inverse: X = multiplier / Rate.
We build the native table directly in that direction and let the base
class pivot it onto the company currency.

The document mixes the BNR xsd namespace into every element, so we parse
it namespace-agnostically: each element is matched on its local tag name
(the part after the closing brace), so a change of namespace URI or
prefix on the BNR side does not silently break the parser.

Source feed:
* https://curs.bnr.ro/nbrfxrates.xml

Data reuse: the reference rates are sourced from the National Bank of
Romania and must be attributed as such. This module is original work;
the parser implements the published XML shape and does not derive from
any third-party rate library.

Source: National Bank of Romania.
