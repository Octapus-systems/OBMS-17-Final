"""
Bank of the Republic (Colombia) official TRM rate source.

The Tasa Representativa del Mercado (TRM) is Colombia's official market
representative exchange rate, set by the Superintendencia Financiera de
Colombia and published through the national open-data portal as a Socrata
JSON dataset. The feed carries a single pair, the peso against the US
dollar, so this source publishes native base USD and lets cross_derive
surface a gap for any other currency.

Endpoint:
* https://www.datos.gov.co/resource/32sa-8pi3.json?$limit=1&$order=vigenciadesde%20DESC

Each record exposes ``valor``, the number of Colombian pesos per one US
dollar, plus the validity window (``vigenciadesde`` / ``vigenciahasta``).
Ordering by ``vigenciadesde`` descending and limiting to one row returns
the latest published TRM; we read that first record and key it as
"1 USD in units of COP". When the array comes back empty (no published
record) we return an empty table, which the base class derivation then
surfaces as a gap, or raises when the company base itself cannot be served.
