Gulf Cooperation Council pegged rates (offline, no network).

Several Gulf currencies hold a hard peg to the US dollar that is fixed
by national decree rather than by a daily market fixing. Because the
peg is a legal constant, there is nothing to download: the rate today
is the rate the decree set and will be the rate until a decree changes
it. This provider therefore serves a static table and never touches the
network, which makes it ideal for offline or air-gapped books and for
shops that simply want the decree-fixed conversion without depending on
a third-party feed being reachable.

Native base is USD. Each entry in ``PEGS`` reads "1 USD = value CODE",
the direction the registry expects, so no inversion is needed. The base
class cross-derives the table onto the company currency, which works
for a company based in USD or in any of the pegged currencies below.

The Kuwaiti Dinar (KWD) is deliberately excluded. Kuwait pegs the dinar
to an undisclosed weighted basket of currencies, not to the dollar
alone, so a fixed USD figure would drift from the official rate and be
wrong on most days. For KWD use the 'cbk' provider, which reads the
Central Bank of Kuwait publication.
