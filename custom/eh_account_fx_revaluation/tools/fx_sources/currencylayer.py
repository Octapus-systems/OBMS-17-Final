"""
Currencylayer aggregator source.

Native base USD. The free tier always quotes against the US dollar
regardless of the requested base, so this provider returns a USD-native
table and lets the base class pivot it onto the company currency through
``cross_derive``. An operator API key (the access_key parameter) is
required, so the provider registers with needs_key=True and the base
class guard rejects a fetch with no key.

The live endpoint serves JSON of the shape::

    {"success": true,
     "source": "USD",
     "quotes": {"USDEUR": 0.9176, "USDGBP": 0.7980, ...}}

Each quotes key is the literal source code 'USD' concatenated with the
quote code, and each value is already "1 USD in units of the quote
currency". That matches the native-base direction this module expects, so
the values pass through with no inversion; only the source prefix is
stripped to recover the bare ISO code.

A request that the API rejects comes back as ``{"success": false,
"error": {"code": ..., "info": ...}}``; we raise RateProviderError with
the upstream info string rather than return an empty table, so the cron
surfaces the outage.
