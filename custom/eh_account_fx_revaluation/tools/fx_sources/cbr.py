"""
Bank of Russia (Tsentralny Bank Rossiyskoy Federatsii) daily rates.

Native base is RUB. The CBR publishes a single XML document for the
latest business day at the endpoint below. The feed is declared as
windows-1251 and uses a decimal comma, both of which are handled
downstream: ElementTree honours the XML encoding declaration when given
bytes, and ``to_decimal`` normalises the comma.

Each ``<Valute>`` carries a ``<Nominal>`` (a quantity of the foreign
currency) and a ``<Value>`` (that quantity expressed in RUB). So the
feed states "Nominal units of CODE = Value RUB", which means
1 CODE = Value / Nominal RUB. Cross derivation wants the table keyed as
"1 RUB = X CODE", which is the inverse: X = Nominal / Value. We build the
native table directly in that direction and let the base class pivot it
onto the company currency.
