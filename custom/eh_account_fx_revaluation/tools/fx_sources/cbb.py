"""
Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) Exchange Rates OpenAPI source.

CBB Exchange Rates OpenAPI lists ~34 currencies as units-per-USD; no API
key; date is DD-MON-YYYY and values are space-padded. BHD is USD-pegged
(0.376) so it falls out of the feed directly; a peg fallback exists in the
gulf-peg provider if the endpoint is down.

The feed is keyed against the US dollar: each row's ``UsCurr`` field is
"1 USD = UsCurr CODE" (units of CODE per one US dollar), which is exactly
the direction the native USD table expects, so values are taken as-is with
no inversion. The base class then cross-derives against the company
currency.

Endpoint:
* https://www.cbb.gov.bh/openapi/ExchangeRate

The endpoint mislabels its Content-Type header as text/html, but the body
is JSON, so ``_download_json`` parses the bytes regardless of header.
``UsCurr`` values are whitespace-padded strings; ``to_decimal`` trims them.
The ``BdCurr`` field (rate against the dinar) is ignored. A row whose
CurrCd is missing, or whose UsCurr parses to None or zero (the BHD self-row
may carry BdCurr 0), is skipped so one bad row never poisons the table.
