Frankfurter foreign-exchange rate source.

Frankfurter is a free, no-key API that serves the European Central Bank
reference rates against any supported base currency, with daily history
back to 1999. Coverage is the roughly 30 currencies the ECB publishes
(major Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific, plus a handful of others).

Unlike the central-bank feeds, this is a multi-base source: the API
accepts the requested base as a query parameter and returns rates that
already mean "1 base = value quote". There is no native base to pivot
through, so this provider overrides ``fetch`` and never calls
``cross_derive``. ``native_base`` is therefore None.

Endpoint shape:

    https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1/{date}?base={BASE}&symbols={CSV}

where ``{date}`` is the ISO date for a historical lookup or the literal
string ``latest`` for the most recent publication. The response is JSON:

    {"amount": 1.0, "base": "USD", "date": "2026-05-01",
     "rates": {"EUR": 0.9176, "GBP": 0.7980}}

An unsupported base produces an error object with no ``rates`` key; we
treat the absence of that key as a hard failure so the caller surfaces
the misconfiguration rather than silently returning nothing.
