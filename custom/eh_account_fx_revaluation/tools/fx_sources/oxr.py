"""
Open Exchange Rates aggregator source.

Native base USD on the free tier: the latest.json endpoint always quotes
against the US dollar regardless of the company currency, so this is a
single-base feed that the base class re-expresses against whatever base
the caller wants. Because of that this provider implements _fetch_native
and never calls cross_derive itself.

An operator API key (the app_id) is required. The base class key guard
raises before any network call when the key is missing.

Each rate is published as "1 USD in units of the listed code", which is
already the native-base direction the cross derivation expects, so the
values pass straight through with no inversion. We send an explicit
symbols list (the base plus the wanted quotes, upper-cased and sorted) so
the response stays small and the base currency is always present for the
pivot.

An error response carries an "error" flag and a human "description"; we
surface that text through RateProviderError so the cron chatter records
the upstream reason (a bad key, an exhausted plan) rather than a generic
parse failure.
