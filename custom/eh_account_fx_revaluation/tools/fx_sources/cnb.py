"""
Czech National Bank (Ceska narodni banka) rate source.

The bank publishes a daily list of central (mid) rates for the
convertible currencies it tracks, expressed as koruna per a stated
number of units of the foreign currency. The JSON endpoint serves the
latest publication; we read its rate list and re-express each quote as
"1 CZK in units of code", which the base class then cross-derives
against the company currency.

Each row carries an ``amount`` field stating how many foreign units the
``rate`` is quoted for (commonly 1, but 100 for low-value currencies
such as the Japanese yen). A row is therefore "amount units of code =
rate CZK", so "1 code = rate/amount CZK" and, native-base CZK,
"1 CZK = amount/rate code". Honouring ``amount`` is essential; treating
every rate as a per-unit figure would mis-scale those currencies.

Endpoint:
* https://api.cnb.cz/cnbapi/exrates/daily?lang=EN

The feed publishes business-day data only; weekend and Czech holiday
requests resolve to the most recent published table, which matches the
provider contract of "the rate on or before this date".

Source: the Czech National Bank. Their terms permit reuse of the
published exchange-rate data provided the source is attributed; this
module surfaces that attribution requirement so deployments quote the
Czech National Bank as the origin of the rates.
