"""
National Bank of Poland (Narodowy Bank Polski) rate source.

The bank publishes "table A", a daily list of the average (mid) rates
for roughly 33 convertible currencies, expressed as zloty per one unit
of the foreign currency. The JSON endpoint serves the latest
publication; we read its newest table and invert each quote so the
native table reads "1 PLN in units of code", which the base class then
cross-derives against the company currency.

Endpoint:
* https://api.nbp.pl/api/exchangerates/tables/A?format=json

The feed publishes business-day data only; weekend and Polish holiday
requests resolve to the most recent published table, which matches the
provider contract of "the rate on or before this date".
