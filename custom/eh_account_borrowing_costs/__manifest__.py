    'description': 'This module capitalises the borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset under IAS 23. For each period it takes the borrowing costs on funds borrowed specifically for the asset, deducts the income earned on the temporary investment of those funds, and adds the borrowing costs on general borrowings by applying the capitalisation rate to the expenditure on the asset. The amount capitalised is capped at the borrowing costs actually incurred in the period, and capitalising posts a single balanced journal entry that reclassifies the amount from the interest expense account to the qualifying asset account. Dated expenditure lines, commencement and cessation dates, and suspension spans are all optional and only refine the base when you use them.',
