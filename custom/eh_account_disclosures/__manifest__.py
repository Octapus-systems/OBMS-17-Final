    'description': "Financial Statement Disclosures maintains seven disclosure registers that a plain ledger does not produce, and generates their numbers instead of asking for them. A related-party register (IAS 24) records relationships, transactions and outstanding balances, ties the outstanding balance back to the linked contact's posted receivable and payable lines, and carries the IAS 24.17 key-management compensation categories with the share-based figure prefilled from the IFRS 2 engine when installed. An operating-segment report (IFRS 8) captures segment revenue, result, assets and liabilities, reconciles the segment totals to entity totals, flags each segment against the IFRS 8.13 ten-percent thresholds, derives segment revenue and result from analytic-tagged postings, and computes the IFRS 8.34 major-customer test from posted revenue by customer. A financial-instrument risk register (IFRS 7) classifies exposures by credit, liquidity and market risk and ties carrying amounts to named ledger accounts. A credit-risk note (IFRS 7.35A-N) auto-feeds its staging table, loss-allowance reconciliation and provision-matrix summary from posted expected-credit-loss runs when the ECL engine is installed, flagging any manual override that disagrees. A contractual-maturity run (IFRS 7.39) buckets undiscounted cash flows from selected liability accounts, per-instrument coupon schedules, open receivables and payables, and IFRS 16 lease schedules, under configurable band schemes. A sensitivity analysis (IFRS 7.40) computes the currency shock on net open monetary positions per currency and the interest-rate shock on floating-rate instruments, with the assumptions disclosed alongside. An interests-in-other-entities register (IFRS 12) records subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and structured entities with ownership, non-controlling interest, significant restrictions and the significant-judgements narrative. Every register can be finalised and locked by an accounting manager, and posts no journal entries.",
