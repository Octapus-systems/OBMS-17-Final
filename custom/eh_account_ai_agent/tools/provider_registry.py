AI provider registry.

Same pattern as the bank-feed connector registry and the Peppol
access-point registry: providers register themselves under a unique
key at import time, and the framework resolves them by key when a
capability needs an LLM call.

The contract is a single method on the provider:

    chat(messages, **kwargs) -> str

`messages` is a list of {'role': 'system' | 'user' | 'assistant',
'content': str} dicts (the de facto LLM API shape that every major
provider speaks). Returns the assistant's completion as a plain
string. Real provider modules implement this against their HTTP
API; stub providers raise ProviderError with an install-the-
extension-module message.

The registry intentionally does NOT make any HTTP calls itself.
All provider integrations live in separate paid extension modules
(eh_account_ai_agent_claude, eh_account_ai_agent_openai, etc.)
that import this module and call register_provider under the same
key as the stub. The override is transparent: company config and
capability call sites do not change on upgrade.
