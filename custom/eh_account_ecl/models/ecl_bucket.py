eh.ecl.bucket: one ageing band in a provision matrix.

Each bucket covers a range of days past due and carries a loss rate. The
expected credit loss on the bucket is its gross carrying amount at that rate
(IFRS 9.5.5.15, simplified approach). Under the general approach the bucket
carries EAD / LGD / PD inputs and its stage is assigned by the run's stage
engine from days-past-due backstops, qualitative flags and cure probation;
forward-looking scenarios on the run probability-weight the result
(IFRS 9.5.5.17).
