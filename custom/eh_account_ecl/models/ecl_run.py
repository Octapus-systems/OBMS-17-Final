"""
eh.ecl.run: a period-end expected credit loss measurement for one company.

Populate: age the company's open receivables by days past their due date at
the reporting date and total the gross carrying amount into each matrix
bucket, split per portfolio segment when segments exist. Compute: under the
general approach, run the stage engine (DPD backstops, qualitative flags,
low-credit-risk exemption, cure probation, POCI pinning) and total the
probability-weighted expected credit loss to the closing allowance; the
simplified approach measures lifetime ECL straight off the matrix. Post:
recognise the movement from the opening allowance in one balanced entry,
debiting impairment loss and crediting the loss-allowance contra-asset on an
increase, and reversing on a decrease (IFRS 9.5.5.8), then build the
per-stage IFRS 7.35H reconciliation. Write-offs consume the recognised
allowance (IFRS 9.5.4.4) and feed back into the reconciliation.
