eh.ecl.recon: the per-stage loss-allowance reconciliation of a posted run.

IFRS 7.35H requires a reconciliation of the opening to the closing loss
allowance per measurement category (12-month, lifetime not credit-impaired,
lifetime credit-impaired, POCI). Each line rolls one stage:

    closing = opening + transfers in - transfers out
              + remeasurement - write-offs

Opening is the prior posted run's closing for the stage; transfers come from
the stage-engine log at the allowance the exposure carried in the prior run;
write-offs are the run's posted allowance write-offs; remeasurement is the
residual measurement change of the period. Lines are engine-generated at
posting time and rebuilt when a linked write-off posts.
