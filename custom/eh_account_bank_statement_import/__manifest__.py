    'description': """Bank Statement Import Pro reads bank statement files into Odoo 17 Community account.bank.statement records, ready for reconciliation. It ships five native parsers behind a single pluggable registry: CSV with a per-bank column profile (column mapping, date format, decimal separator, currency), OFX, QIF (Quicken Interchange Format), CAMT.053 (ISO 20022), and MT940 (SWIFT) including the multi-line :86: extension blocks for end-to-end reference and counterparty extraction. New formats are added by registering a parser class, not by forking the importer. The CSV, QIF, CAMT.053 and MT940 parsers use only the Python standard library; OFX import additionally needs the lightweight ofxparse package (pip install ofxparse), imported lazily so the other four formats work without it.

Duplicate handling is two layers. First, exact per-line idempotency: a database constraint on (journal, unique import reference) means re-importing the same file skips the lines already seen on that journal instead of doubling them. Second, a fuzzy cross-source scan that catches the same payment imported once via CSV and again via OFX with different per-line references, keyed on journal plus amount to the cent plus a 3-day value-date window plus reference and narration substring overlap. The fuzzy match only flags (it records the suspected original on the line and posts a chatter note), it never blocks or deletes either side, so the operator decides.

Every file import writes a row to the import history log (file hash, user, line count, skipped count, outcome) whether the run succeeded, was a duplicate no-op, or failed, so failed and skipped imports stay in the audit trail with the exact exception text. Bad rows are explicit: a parser raises a precise error naming the offending row, tag, or field, and the wizard records it as an audited error rather than silently dropping data.

A pluggable live-connector framework (a connector profile model plus an abstract LiveBankConnector contract) lets partner packages register named-bank connectors against a 2-hourly cron. Plaid, Basiq, GoCardless, and manual adapters ship as stubs that validate credentials and raise a clear "install the extension module" message; the optional eh_account_bank_statement_import_plaid, _basiq and _gocardless modules override their key with a real HTTP feed. The cron runs each profile under its own savepoint so one crashing connector rolls back only itself, and a since-date watermark auto-advances to the latest fetched posted date to avoid re-pulling the same window.

Multi-company aware: profiles and statements are scoped through the bank journal, which carries the company. Pairs with the reconciliation workspace that sits on top of the imported statements.""",
