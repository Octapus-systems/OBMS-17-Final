GoCardless connector stub.

Targets EU and UK banks via GoCardless Bank Account Data (the former
Nordigen Open Banking API). Same stub pattern as the Plaid and Basiq
connectors: it registers the 'gocardless' key and validates the
credential shape so a deployment can configure profiles against it from
day one, but it does not make HTTP calls. The live integration ships in
the separate `eh_account_bank_statement_import_gocardless` module, which
imports this key and overrides fetch_transactions to call the real
bankaccountdata.gocardless.com API.

Registering the stub here keeps the live-connector form view honest: the
GoCardless credentials group is backed by a selectable key whether or not
the live module is installed, and the operator gets a clear "install the
extension" error instead of a silent dead option.

Configuration shape (stored in profile.credentials_json):

    {
        "secret_id":   "...",       # GoCardless secret id
        "secret_key":  "...",       # GoCardless secret key
        "account_id":  "...",       # GoCardless account id (one per profile)
    }
