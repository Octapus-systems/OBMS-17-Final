Live bank connector base class.

A connector is a plain Python class that knows how to authenticate
against a single bank and pull recent transactions for one account.
The framework treats every connector identically; concrete
implementations live in their own packages so legal, jurisdictional,
or partnership constraints stay contained.

The contract (override these on a concrete subclass):

* `CONNECTOR_KEY` -- short, lowercase, unique. Stored on the profile
  record so the framework can resolve which connector to invoke.
* `CONNECTOR_LABEL` -- human-readable name for selection menus.
* `authenticate(profile)` -> dict of session credentials. Called at the
  top of every fetch; the framework caches the returned dict for the
  duration of one fetch run only, so connectors do not have to
  persist tokens themselves.
* `fetch_transactions(profile, since_date, until_date, session)`
  -> iterable of `BankTransaction` records.

Connector implementations MUST NOT touch the Odoo ORM directly. They
operate on plain Python dicts and the profile (which is a plain
namedtuple-style passthrough). The framework converts the returned
records into `account.bank.statement.line` entries inside a
per-statement savepoint so a single bad transaction does not freeze
the run.

Idempotency is the framework's responsibility: every transaction
carries a `provider_reference` and the framework refuses to import a
transaction whose reference has been seen before for the same
account. Connectors MUST set provider_reference; if a bank does not
expose one, derive it deterministically from the transaction's date,
amount, and counterparty (the upstream import_log already handles
de-duplication on the same key).

      Required. If the bank does not expose one, derive a deterministic
      hash from date, amount, counterparty inside the connector.
    * `posted_date` -- value date as recorded by the bank.
    * `amount` -- positive for credit (money in), negative for debit
      (money out). The framework writes this directly as the statement
      line `amount` after the journal's currency rounding.
    * `currency` -- ISO 4217 code; the framework will reject the line
      if this differs from the journal's currency unless the journal
      itself is multi-currency enabled.
    * `counterparty_name`, `counterparty_account` -- best-effort
      attribution; safe to leave blank.
    * `description` -- free-form narrative the bank attached.
    * `extra` -- catch-all dict for connector-specific metadata; the
      framework persists it on the import_log.line row but does not
      use it for matching or import semantics.
