Plaid connector stub.

Targets US, CA, UK, IE, FR, ES, NL banks via Plaid's aggregator API
(/transactions/sync endpoint family). Ships the credentials shape and
the registration entry so a deployment can configure profiles against
this key from day one. The actual HTTP integration is intentionally
NOT shipped here: a production-ready Plaid integration needs a paid
client_id / secret pair and a deployment-specific callback host for
the Plaid Link flow, both of which differ per customer.

Sites that need the live integration install
`eh_account_bank_statement_import_plaid` (separate paid module from
ERP Heritage or a partner) which imports this module and overrides
`fetch_transactions` to make the actual /transactions/sync call.

The override pattern matters: by registering here under the same
CONNECTOR_KEY, the partner module replaces the stub in the registry
without changing any profile data or migration. Operators flip
nothing on upgrade.

Configuration shape (stored in profile.credentials_json as JSON):

    {
        "client_id":     "...",          # Plaid client id
        "secret":        "...",          # Plaid secret (sandbox/dev/prod)
        "access_token":  "...",          # per-item access token from Link
        "account_id":    "...",          # Plaid account id (one per profile)
        "environment":   "sandbox" | "development" | "production"
    }

The stub validates the shape and raises ConnectorError when fields
are missing so misconfiguration surfaces at the first cron pass
rather than mid-fetch.
