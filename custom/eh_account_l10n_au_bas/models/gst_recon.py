eh.bas.gst.recon.result: transient holder for the 1A/1B vs GL
reconciliation produced by eh.bas.run.compute_gst_control_reconciliation.

Built as a transient model so the result lives only for the user's
current session and does not pollute the database with snapshots that
would go stale the next time the BAS is recomputed.
