eh.revenue.constraint.review: a periodic reassessment of the variable
consideration estimate and its constraint (IFRS 15.56, 15.59).

IFRS 15.56 requires the entity to update the estimated transaction price,
including the constrained variable consideration, at the end of each
reporting period. This model is the workflow and audit trail for that
reassessment: a draft review snapshots the obligation's current estimate and
constraint, the reviewer records the revised amounts and the rationale, and
applying the review writes the new values onto the obligation and trues
revenue up through the contract's normal recognition run, so the change
posts as a balanced catch-up (or reversal), never a silent restatement.
Applied reviews are frozen; together they are the period-by-period audit
trail the standard asks for.
