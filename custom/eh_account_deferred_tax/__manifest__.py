    'name': 'Deferred Tax (IAS 12)',
    'summary': 'IAS 12 deferred tax for Odoo 17 Community that records temporary differences as carrying amount versus tax base, resolves enacted rates from a per-jurisdiction rate table, discloses rate-change remeasurement separately from origination, offsets DTA against DTL per jurisdiction, and posts only the period movement, odoo 19 deferred tax, IAS 12, deferred tax asset liability, temporary differences, tax base carrying amount, effective tax rate reconciliation, tax losses carried forward, deferred tax OCI, IAS 12.74 offsetting, enacted tax rate table, balance-sheet liability method.',
    'description': "This module computes deferred tax under the IAS 12 balance-sheet liability method. Each temporary difference is entered as a carrying amount and a tax base; the gap, classified taxable or deductible from the item's nature (asset, liability, or tax loss), is measured at the enacted rate resolved from a per-jurisdiction rate table at the reporting date (IAS 12.47), with a reasoned manual override and a statutory fallback. A run compares the closing position to the opening position, splits the movement into rate-change remeasurement versus origination (IAS 12.60(b)), and posts one balanced journal for the movement, recognising it in profit or loss except for lines flagged as OCI-related, whose movement routes to the OCI reserve (IAS 12.61A). Deferred tax assets are capped by line-level recoverable-profit ceilings, carryforward expiry dates, and a run-level projected-profit ceiling, with the unrecognised portion disclosed (IAS 12.81(e)). The run presents gross or net-by-jurisdiction positions (IAS 12.74) and builds the effective-tax-rate reconciliation as auto plus manual reconciling rows that always tie to the total tax expense (IAS 12.81(c)). Posting and reversal are gated to the EH Accounting Manager group and stamped for audit.",
