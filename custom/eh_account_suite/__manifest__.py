Why install the bundle
----------------------

* **One version stream.** Every constituent module is on the same Odoo
  19 release line. The bundle's manifest version anchors the
  combination tested as a set.
* **One support contact.** Every module ships under the same publisher
  (ERP Heritage). Support and updates come from one source.
* **One install.** Customers stop hunting through 51 separate Apps Store
  listings. One click brings the entire suite into a Community database.
* **Engineering bar held across the suite.** Test coverage, isolation
  rules, audit logs, multi-company scoping, IFRS / IAS adherence are
  consistent across every module.

Engineering principles
----------------------

* Multi-company aware throughout. Every model declares company scoping;
  every isolation rule is global.
* No silent fallbacks. Missing rates, missing accounts, missing
  configuration each surface explicit messages.
* Performance-gated tests. Render-time thresholds and bounded query
  counts are asserted on report, asset, FX and AP flows, alongside
  combination tests across multi-company, multi-currency, fiscal
  positions and lock dates.
